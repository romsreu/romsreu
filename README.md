# Hi there! 👋 I'm Román.

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

Here you'll find three types of projects:
- 🎓 **[U]niversity projects** — academic work from my degree at UTN.
- 🔧 **[P]ersonal projects** — things I build to learn, experiment, and have fun coding.

I’m currently working on: [**Hotel_Premier**](https://github.com/romsreu/Hotel_Premier)

<!--
**romsreu/romsreu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
